# Mission Demolition - Game Enhancements

## Enhancement: Scoring System

### What it does
Players now earn points based on their performance (less shots = higher score)

### System specifics
- **Base score:** 1000 points per level
- **Shot penalty:** -50 points per shot used
- **Minimum score:** 100 points per level (even with many shots)

**Example:**
- Complete level in 3 shots: 1000 - (3 × 50) = 850 points
- Complete level in 10 shots: 1000 - (10 × 50) = 500 points
- Complete level in 20+ shots: 100 points (minimum)
